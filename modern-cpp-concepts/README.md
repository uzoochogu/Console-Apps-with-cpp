# What is this repo anbout?

I hopped back on C++ after 2 years away from it and discovered that I didn't know about the Modern CPP concept.

Here I would go over some of the concepts and try to write simple programs demonstrating them. I will be using the latest C++20 standards (which includes C++11, 14, 17 standards)

I will start from pretty basic things from the old cpp and ramp up quickly as time progresses. 

## Topics Discussed
1. Abstract Base Class
