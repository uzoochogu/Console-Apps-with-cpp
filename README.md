# Console-Apps-with-cpp

I use this repo to keep track of useful c++ concepts and implement data structures and algorithms. 
I will be updating it with newer c++ standards and trying them out here. 
I have also solved many Leetcode problems here, complete with an interface for testing them.

This repositary consists of 
1. Data Structure and Algorithms: Implemented common Data Structures, Algorithms and solved LeetCode Problems
2. Modern cpp concepts: C++17, C++20 tools, Design Principles examples and Good Programming Practices
3. Some standalone CLI projects in C++ and C (😁) : Consult Price Register is an Old repo containing my earliest C++ programs. It consists of two separate programs:
   > - A Price Register that stores the prices of items in a store in a simple text file.
   > - Code generator - This generates a voucher code that can be submitted to redeem unpaid change. The time of purchase and price of item is encoded using a crude encoding technique.
