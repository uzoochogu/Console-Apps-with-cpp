# Console-Apps-with-cpp

I use this repo to keep track of useful c++ concepts and implement data structures and algorithms. 
I will be updating it with newer c++ standards and trying them out here. 

This repositary consists of 
1. Data Structure and Algorithms:
2. Modern cpp concepts
3. Some standalone CLI projects in C++ or C (😁)
